## Environment 
The environment used to develop this package can be cloned from the environment.yml file. To clone the environment:

`conda env create -f environment.yml` 

The name of the environment is tr_tjump_saxs and is determined by the first line in the environment.yml file. 
If you would like to change the name, replace tr_tjump_saxs with your preferred name in the first line of the environment.yml file. 

## Install
To get this code, simply clone the git repository:

`git clone  https://github.com/ScientistAsh/tr_tjump_saxs.git`

## Usage 
Extensive docstrings are provided in the source code to explain the usage, input parameters, output, and examples.
For more extensive discussion on how to use the code, tutorial files are provided in the TUTORIALS. 
The tutorials are in Jupyter Notebooks and allow for interactive usage (note that you must have SAXS data for interactive usage).
It is recommended to either use Jupyter Notebooks or to write scripts and run them non-interactively.
