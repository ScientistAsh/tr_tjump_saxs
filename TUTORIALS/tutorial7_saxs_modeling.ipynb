    "Currently the [tr_tjump_saxs](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads \"tr_tjump_saxs\") package only works through the Python3 command line. The full dependencies can be found on the [Henderson GitLab Page](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads \"tr_tjump_saxs\") and the environment can be cloned from the [environment.yml file](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/blob/main/environment.yml?ref_type=heads \"environment.yml file\"). The data analysis can be executed from an interactive Python command line such as [iPython](https://www.python.org/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or the code can be written in a script to run in a non-interactive mode. The preferred usage is in Jupyter Lab as this is the environment the package was developed in. Jupyter also provides a file where all code, output of code, and notes can be contained in a single file and serves as a record of the data analysis performed, the code used to conduct the data analysis, and the output of the analysis. \n",

    "In this Tutorial 7 notebook, I introduce the `saxs_modeling` module from the `tr_tjump_saxs` package.

    "# SAXS Modeling Overview\n",
    "There are many options for how to model SAXS data and the best approach will be dictated by the molecule of interest and the specific questions involved. Structures can be estimated from the SAXS curves and/or SAXS curves can be calculated from structural models. This notebook tutorial will cover the modeling pipeline we used to study [HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein structural dynamics](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj0396).\n",
    "\n",
    "The overview of our SAXS modeling pipeline is shown in [Figure 1](#Figure-1). To deterimine an all-atom model of the HIV-1 Env associated with the TR, T-Jump SAXS curves in our recent publication we chose to **build models** of Env in known structural states and calculate the theoretical SAXS curves for each model. We used the software [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/ \"Modeller\") to build homology models using cryo-EM structures as templates. We then used the [FoXS server](https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/foxs/ \"FoXS Server\") to **calculate the theoretical scattering curves** from the atomic models. Alternatively, [CRYSOL from the ATSAS Software Suite](https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html \"CRYSOL from the ATSAS Software Suite\") can be used to calculate theoretical scattering curves from the atomic models. CRYSOL offers the advantage that it can be run from the command line and thus can be automated over multiple structures at once. Once the scattering curves for the models are calculated, these **theoretical scattering curves can be fit or matched to experimental static SAXS scattering curves**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **pair distance distributions** can be calulcated from both the experimental and theoretical curves using the [ATSAS Software Suite](https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html \"ATSAS Software Suite\"). This distribution is the Fourier transform of the scattering intensity and indicates the pairwise distances contributing to the scattering curves. It is helpful to compare the theoretical pair distance distributions with the experimental pair distance distributions when fitting the theoretical SAXS curves to the experimental SAXS cuvres. \n",
    "\n",
    "To relate the atomic models fit to the static SAXS data to TR, T-Jump SAXS curves, **difference curves** need to be determined. The TR, T-Jump SAXS data contains signal indicating movement in the protein. To determine what structural transition is associated with the TR, T-Jump SAXS signal we calculated the difference between theoretical curves from 2 different models and compared to the extracted SVD/REGALS signals determined from the kinetic analysis. To associate pair wise distances involved with these transitions, we calculated the **pair distance distribution differences**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the `saxs_modeling` module only includes the function to calculate pair distance distribution differences. But more functions to handle more of the modeling pipeline will be added in the future. "

    "## Function Overview\n",
    "The `tr_tjump_saxs` package uses an interpolation method to calculate the difference between two given pair distance distribution functions. This interpolation is needed becaue two different pair distance distribution functions do no necessarily have the same x-values and therefore interpolation is required to calculate the difference. The `delta_pr()` function will perform this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Parameters\n",
    "`delta_pr()` has 2 required input parameters and some additional parameters for user control. \n",
    ">1. `curve1` and `curve2` are the only required parameters and indicate the data arrays containing the pair distance distributions to determine the difference for. The difference is calculated as `curve1 - curve2`. <br>\n",
    "> 2. The `delim1` and `delim2` parameters indicate the delimiter used in the files for `curve1` and `curve2`, respectively. <br>\n",
    "> 3. `skip1` and `skip2` indicate the number of rows to skip when loading `curve1` and `curve2`, respectively. <br>\n",
    "> 4. The `kind` parameter indicates the interpolation method to be used. The options for this can be found in the [SciPy docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html). <br>\n",
    ">5. The `fill_value` parameter indicates the method to use for filling in missing values. The options for this setting come from the [SciPy docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp1d.html). <br>\n",
