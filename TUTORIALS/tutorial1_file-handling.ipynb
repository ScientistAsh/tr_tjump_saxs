    "Currently the [tr_tjump_saxs](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads \"tr_tjump_saxs\") package only works through the Python3 command line. The full dependencies can be found on the [Henderson GitLab Page](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads \"tr_tjump_saxs\") and the environment can be cloned from the [environment.yml file](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/blob/main/environment.yml?ref_type=heads \"environment.yml file\"). The data analysis can be executed from an interactive Python command line such as [iPython](https://www.python.org/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or the code can be written in a script to run in a non-interactive mode. The preferred usage is in Jupyter Lab as this is the environment the package was developed in. Jupyter also provides a file where all code, output of code, and notes can be contained in a single file and serves a record of the data analysis performed, the code used to conduct the data analysis, and the output of the analysis. \n",

    "# Tutorial 1 Introduction\n",
    "In this Tutorial 1 notebook, I introduce the `file_handling` module from the `tr_tjump_saxs` package. The `file_handling` module provides functions that will load or plot a single SAXS curve or a full set of SAXS curves as well as other functions to create file lists and directories for storing output data. If you find any issues with this tutorial, please create an issue on the repository GitLab page ([tr_tjump_saxs issues](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/tr_t-jump_saxs/y22-23/-/issues \"tr_tjump_saxs Issues\")).\n",

    "## `load_saxs()` Function \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "After importing the analysis modules, we then need to load the data files. The `tr_tjump_saxs` package has 2 different options for loading SAXS data. You can load only one curve at a time with the `load_saxs()` function or you can load a full set of curves at one time with the `load_set()` function. First, we will look at how to load one curve with the `load_saxs()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `load_saxs()` is best suited for loading a single SAXS scattering or difference curve. This function will automatically load all columns. The `load_set()` function is best suited for loading a set of SAXS scattering or difference curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Parameters\n",
    "There are three input parameters for this function:\n",
    "> 1. `file` indicates the file, including the full path, containing the SAXS curve. <br>\n",
    "> 2. `delim` indicates the delimitter used in the input file. This parameter is optional and has the default value ' ' (space-delimitted). <br>\n",
    "> 3. `mask` parameter indicates the number of rows that need to be skipped when loading the file. This can be used to skip rows in which a mask is applied to the data so the curve contains NaN values or to avoid importing string-type headers. Because this function loads the data as a np.array and np.arrays can only contain one data type, this function will raise an error if string-type headers are attemped to import at the same time as the SAXS scattering/difference curve. This parameter is optional and the default value is 0 (all rows imported).  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returned Values\n",
    "> 1. A numpy array with a shape determined by input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Raised Errors\n",
    "There are no custom errors raised by this function. If any errors are raised, follow the docs for the function indicated in the traceback. \n",

    "## Slicing Returned Values\n",
    "Once a curve is loaded, you will want to work with this curve. The proper slicing will be important for conducting the correct analysis. In Python the starting value for the slicing is inclusive while the slicing value for the end of the range is not. So, if you want row 50 to be the last row in the slice, than the slicing range must end at 51. Generally speaking, the scattering vector (here referred to as q) is typically stored as the first column and the scattering intensity (i) as the second column. In numpy arrays, columns and rows are 0-indexed, meaning that the first column has index 0, the second column has index 1, and so on. \n",

    "### Returning q values\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The first step to load a set of SAXS curves, is to create a file list. This can be done manually, which is usually easiest if your list only contains one or two files. Alternatively, there is the `make_flist()` function. This function will automatically generate a file list given an input directory, prefix and suffix. This function is ideal for loading a set of curves, usually the reduced scattering curves, that are all in the same folder. This function will not be useful for creating files lists of files in different folders. A file list of files from different folders would have to be created using alternative methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Parameters\n",
    "> 1. The `directory` parameter indicates the directory where the scattering curves are stored and is an optional parameter with the default value being the current working directory. <br>\n",
    "> 2. The `prefix` parameter indicates the prefix of the files to be loaded. This parameter is useful when you only want to load a subset of files from the given directory. When set to None, the files will not be filtered by prefix. The `prefix` parameter is optional and has the default value of `None`.<br>\n",
    ">3. The `suffix` parameter indicates the file suffix to filter by. If set to None then no suffix filters are applied to the files. `suffix` is an optional parameter and the default value is `None`. If both `prefix` and `suffix` are `None` then all files in the given directory will be loaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Returned Values\n",
    "This function returns a list containing the appended files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Raised Errors\n",
    "This function raises no custom errors. For any errors raised, see the documentation for the function indicated in the traceback. \n",
